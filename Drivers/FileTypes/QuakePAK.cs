    // This driver allows JCR6 to read the PAK files Quake I uses. I do not 
    // know if it supports later instalments of Quake.
    // The QuakePAK format is rather just an improved version of the WAD 
    // system and therefore it was easy to redo the code needed for WAD to
    // Make it support this system, although some very significant differences
    // are still there.
    // Here too, I just as I did with WAD, I copied my original BlitzMax code
    // into C# and I traslated it. ;)

    // The original BlitzMax version I used was: 15.09.23
