    /* This driver should allow JCR6 to load WAD files 
     * as used in DOOM, DOOM II, Ultimate DOOM, Heretic, HeXen, 
     * Rise of the Triad, Hexx and maybe even a few more games.
     * 
     * It should also auto detect the strange way maps were put in WAD files.
     * Now I just copied my original BlitzMax code into C# and translated it 
     * in order to make C# understand it. 
     * 
     * Not the most elegant way to do it, but hey, what works that works, right?
     * 
     * The BlitzMax code I used was version 15.09.23
