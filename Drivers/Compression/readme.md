# Compression drivers

This is where compression drivers for JCR6 go.
Some may come with one single file, others with an entire folder (which must then be included or linked to in full or compilers errors will surely come).

Please note, I am not really the kind of person to write compression algorithms. Other people did that for me, and I just coded the code that turns it into a JCR6 driver. Honor to whom honor is due. All copyrights and licenses go to the respective developers, and all developers of those algorithms allowed me to use this stuff either by direct permission or by a license type giving everybody these permissions.
