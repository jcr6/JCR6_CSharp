# JCR6 zlib drivers

This folder provides the drivers JCR6 needs to support zlib compression.
All files in this folder (and subfolder) are required, if one is missing stuff may not work properly.

# Dependencies

You only need to have the MKL.cs file in the TrickyUnits to be present for this driver to work, which was a requirement for JCR6 anyway. No further dependencies are required.


# License

All I can take credit for is that I could turn this all into a wrapper, and most of it contains code I just copied from example programs, which has only been adapted for usage in JCR6. 
The Wrapper file has been licened under a zLib license, but it should be taken into account that this could be changed over time to fit the rest of the drivers.
The source code of the zlib library itself has a BSD kind of license and all credit and copyrights are and remain for the respective creators.

Of course, the original zlib compression library was written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler The primary site for the zlib compression library is http://www.zlib.net
Gailly and Adler licened their library under the (duh!) zlib license.

The code on which the wrapper was created is Copyright (c) 2006, ComponentAce

# Usage

Before JCR6 can use the zlib compression routines you must initialize the driver.
You can either do that this way:
~~~C#
   new JCR6_zlib();
~~~

Or this way:
~~~C#
   JCR6_zlib.Init();
~~~

Both commands will cause the same effect, although the upper option may throw a warning since it creates a value which is unassigned (at least that's what the outliner and maybe even the parser inside the compiler think, as the through is that the created values is automatically assigned inside the JCR6 driver map.... Details, details :P )
